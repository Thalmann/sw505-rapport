\paragraph{Purpose:}The purpose of this project was to map an unknown area using a robot, which location is given by an external device and thus, always known.

\paragraph{Method:}To accomplish this, a robot was built using \legoms, consisting of a rotating ultra-sonic-sensor-construction built on top of a tripod.\thilemann{hvorfor sammentrækning og man kan vel ikke kalde det for en tripod hvor sensoren er monteret?}
The purpose of the robot was to navigate and collect sensor measurements and provide these to a PC, which would construct a map based on the supplied data.
This would result in a continuously updated occupancy grid, by using a simple- or Gaussian sensor model).
Additionally, as a simplification of the problem, a PC would supply the robot with its location and orientation (pose), based on color-tracking a live stream from a Kinect, whenever needed.\thilemann{sidste del bør omformuleres}
