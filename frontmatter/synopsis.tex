\paragraph{Purpose:}The purpose of this project was to map an unknown area, using a robot (mapping).

\paragraph{Method:}To accomplish this, a robot was built using \legoms, consisting of a rotating ultra-sonic-sensor-construction built on top of a tripod.
The purpose of the robot was to navigate and collect sensor measurements and provide these to a PC, which would construct a map based on the supplied data.
This would result in a continuously updated occupancy grid, using a sensor model (both simple and Gaussian variants).
Additionally, as a simplification of the problem, the PC would supply the robot with its location and orientation (pose), based on color-tracking a live stream from a Kinect, whenever needed.

\paragraph{Results and conclusion:}
